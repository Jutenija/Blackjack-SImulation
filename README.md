Simulate games of Blackjack using different strategies

## Abstract
Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is a popular casino card game played with at least 
one standard 52-card deck. As with all casino games, the odds of winning over time are 
stacked against the player. The win rates of several different basic Blackjack strategies 
using six decks of cards over ten thousand rounds of Blackjack were explored and 
compared. The goal of the simulation was to identify the best strategy to minimize betting 
losses. Python programming was used to construct the simulation of a Blackjack table with 
multiple players each betting the same amount of money. Utilizing the basic strategies 
provided by Bicycle Cards and Blackjack Apprenticeship resulted in the highest win ratios, 
but ultimately still yield losses in money over time against the House. Further investigation 
reveals differences in performance based on playersâ€™ starting hands, dealer upcards, and 
the decision to hit or stand at a given point in the game.
